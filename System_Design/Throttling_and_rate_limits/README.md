🧠 1. What Is Throttling?

Throttling (a.k.a. rate limiting) is a technique to limit the number of API requests a user/client can make in a specific time window.

Think of it as a way to say:

❗ “You can call this API 100 times per hour — no more!”

This helps you:
	•	🚫 Stop spam or brute force attacks
	•	💰 Control API usage to reduce server load and cloud costs
	•	🔐 Enforce fair usage among users
🚥 2. How It Works

You enable throttling by:
	•	Enabling throttle classes
	•	Defining rate limits like 100/day, 10/minute, etc.
