## 💡 Essential Patterns You MUST Master

### 1. **Recursive DFS** (90% of tree problems)
```python
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return base_case

    left = dfs(node.left)
    right = dfs(node.right)

    return combine(node.val, left, right)
```

### 2. **Iterative with Stack** (For "without recursion" variants)
```python
def iterative_dfs(root):
    if not root:
        return

    stack = [root]
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        # Process node
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
```

### 3. **BFS with Queue** (Level order problems)
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(root):
    if not root:
        return

    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process node
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
```

### 4. **BST Property** (Inorder = Sorted)
```python
def inorder(node):
    if not node:
        return []

    return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
```

### 5. **Global Variables** (For path sums, diameters)
```python
def max_path_sum(root):
    max_sum = float('-inf')

    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal max_sum
        if not node:
            return 0

        left = max(0, dfs(node.left))
        right = max(0, dfs(node.right))

        max_sum = max(max_sum, node.val + left + right)

        return node.val + max(left, right)

    dfs(root)
    return max_sum
```

### 6. **Parent Tracking** (For LCA, distance problems)
```python
def find_parent(root, target):
    parent = {}

    def dfs(node, par=None):
        if not node:
            return
        parent[node] = par
        dfs(node.left, node)
        dfs(node.right, node)

    dfs(root)
    return parent
```
