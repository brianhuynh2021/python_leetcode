''' `map` and `filter` are built-in Python functions that allow you to 
    perform operations on iterable objects 
    (e.g., lists, tuples) in a concise and functional manner. 
    They are often used with lambda functions or regular functions to 
    apply transformations and filters to the elements of an iterable.'''

# map(function, iterable)    # Use map when you want to apply a specific function to each element.
# filter(function, iterable) # Use filter when you want to filter elements from an iterable based on a specific condition.

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# squared = map(square, numbers)
# evens = filter(is_even, numbers)
squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
squared_list = list(squared)
evens_list = list(evens)

print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(evens_list)    # Output: [2, 4]
