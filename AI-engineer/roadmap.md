## FAANG Interview Focus

### What They Look For:
1. **Deep understanding of transformers** (not just API usage)
2. **System design for AI** (scalability, latency, cost)
3. **Production experience** (deployment, monitoring)
4. **Research awareness** (latest papers, techniques)
5. **Coding skills** (still need LeetCode medium/hard)

### Interview Types:
- ML Coding (implement attention, LoRA)
- System Design (design recommendation system)
- ML Theory (explain RLHF, fine-tuning)
- Behavioral (project deep-dives)

## Success Metrics

By Month 6, you should have:
- ✅ 3-5 production AI projects on GitHub
- ✅ 1 open-source contribution
- ✅ Blog posts explaining your projects
- ✅ Strong portfolio website
- ✅ 100+ LeetCode problems solved
- ✅ Can design AI systems on whiteboard

**Target Roles**: AI Engineer, ML Engineer (LLM focus), Applied Scientist

## Notes

This is an aggressive but achievable roadmap with full-time dedication. Focus on **depth over breadth** - FAANG wants specialists in modern AI, particularly in LLMs and production systems.

**Key Differentiator**: Don't just use APIs - understand and implement the underlying algorithms. FAANG interviews will test your deep understanding, not just surface-level knowledge.
